# Scripts for processing datasets

Original repository at: [https://github.com/dmitrijsk/AttentionHTR/tree/main/datasets](https://github.com/dmitrijsk/AttentionHTR/tree/main/datasets).

This folder contains scripts that process the datasets into train, validation and test partitions in a way required to create LMDB datasets.

## IAM 

* Download the IAM dataset from [here](https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database) and place the word-level images into the `iam/words` directory. 
* The `/iam_rwth_partitions` directory contains the RWTH Aachen partitions, taken from [the official GitHub repository](https://github.com/omni-us/research-seq2seq-HTR) of [1].
* Run `python3 process_iam.py` to create `iam_train`, `iam_val` and `iam_test` directories with images and gt.txt.
* Convert each partition into an LMDB dataset using the instructions on [the main page](https://github.com/dmitrijsk/AttentionHTR#lmdb-datasets).

Run `python3 process_iam.py --help` to see available command line arguments.
